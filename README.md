## Mini Algorithm Exercise

_Title: "Sharing Elements"_

_Difficulty: Medium_

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes two arguments, a given array, `arr`, and a number, `size`.
- Using the elements from `arr`, the function should create _new arrays_ which consist of a maximum of `size` elements.
- Any remaining elements should be placed in the final array.
- The output should be an array of arrays.

> i.e.:
> 
> input => `[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i], 4`
> 
> output => `[[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g, h], [i]]`

### Restrictions

- No `for` loops allowed.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!
